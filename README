  I. INTRODUCTION

This readme describes how to compile the EE105 labs. They are written in LaTeX
and require certain packages and utilities that will be described below.
Editing these labs requires knowledge of LaTeX. Editing diagrams requires
knowledge of the circuit_macros package, and editing graphs requires knowledge
of the Asymptote software.

This document should be written with the standard 80 column width. All URLs
should be enclosed within square brackets to eliminate ambiguities.

--------------------------------------

 II. REQUIRED SOFTWARE

1. LaTeX

   Windows (Cygwin)
   a. MiKTeX [http://miktex.org/]
   b. teTeX [http://www.tug.org/tetex/]
   c. TeX Live [http://www.tug.org/texlive/]

   MacOS, Linux
   a. MacTeX [http://www.tug.org/mactex/]
   b. TeX Live [http://www.tug.org/texlive/]

   Although there are many LaTeX packages, we've tested the ones listed above
   and have confirmed their functionality with these labs. It is essential that
   the LaTeX package you have includes latex, dvips, and gs (Ghostscript).
   Ghostscript is also available separately from
   [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/GPL/index.htm].

2. Asymptote [http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/]

   For MacOS, Asymptote needs to be compiled from source. Download the source
   and run the following commands:

   $ ./configure
   $ sudo make all
   $ sudo make install

3. Circuit Macros [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/circuit_macros/]

   The circuit_macros package requires certain Groff utilities, available from
   [http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/]. Most installations of MacOS and Linux
   should have these packages already installed or available via a repository.
   Cygwin packages are available from [http://loreley.ath.cx/cygwin/groff/].
   Cygwin does not by default include the latest version of Groff, so it is
   necessary to download this package if using Cygwin.

--------------------------------------

III. COMPILATION

To compile the labs, simply run 'make' from the ee105 directory. You can clean
all files created by make by typing 'make clean'. To test whether you have all
the necessary software to compile the labs, type 'make test'. Any missing
software will be reported.

--------------------------------------

 IV. DOCUMENTATION

Further documentation is available as a LaTeX document, which will be compiled
to a PDF after following the instructions above. It is located in the
Documentation directory.

  V. AUTHORS

These labs were written by the following students at UC Berkeley during the
summer of 2007, listed alphabetically by name:

  * Jonathan Ellithorpe
  * Matt Johnson
  * Wilson Ko
  * Chen Sun
  * Eudean Sun
  * Kevin Wang

Support from Prof. Tsu-Jae King Liu, Ferenc Kovac, Tho Nguyen, and the rest of
the ESG staff was essential to the authoring of these labs. The original EE105
labs, authored by W.T. Yeung and R.T. Howe, were extremely useful references
for authoring these labs.
