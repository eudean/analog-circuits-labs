Attach your netlists and plots in the order you created them for the lab. For 3.1, only include one netlist for one transient analysis step time. \textbf{Remember to print with a white background.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[3.1.4] What is the value measured from the graph? How does the value from the graph compare to the value you'd expect from the RC time constant?
  \\~\\~\\~\\
  \item[3.1.5] What is the value measured with the \texttt{.measure} statement? How does the result of the \texttt{.measure} statement compare to the result from the graph?
  \\~\\~\\~\\
  \item[3.1.6] What effect does changing the step time have on the result of the \texttt{.measure} statement?
  \\~\\~\\~\\
  \item[3.3.2] What is the voltage gain?
